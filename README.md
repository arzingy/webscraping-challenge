## Part 2 (Mars Weather)
According to the data I scraped from <a href='https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html'>Mars Temperature Data Site</a>, there are 12 months on Mars. The data provides information for 1867 sols (Martian days):

</br>Below you can see graphs for average minimum temperature on Mars:
</br>![Average Minimum Temperatures](./MarsScraping/screenshots/2_temp.png)
</br>![Average Minimum Temperatures Sorted](./MarsScraping/screenshots/2_temp_sorted.png)
</br>As we can see, the 3rd month has the lowest average min temperatures, and the 8th month has the highest average min temperatures.

</br>Below you can see graphs for average pressure on Mars:
</br>![Average Pressure](./MarsScraping/screenshots/2_pressure.png)
</br>![Average Pressure Sorted](./MarsScraping/screenshots/2_pressure_sorted.png)
</br> As we can see, the 6th month has the lowest average pressure, while the 9th month has the highest average pressure.

</br>Below you can see the graph that shows the daily minimum temperature of each observation in the data set:
</br>![All Minimum Temperatures](./MarsScraping/screenshots/2_temp_all.png)
</br> As we can see, the distance both between highest and lowest peaks is roughly 650 (750-100 and 1125-475).
</br> As can be seen on <a href='https://science.nasa.gov/mars/facts/'>NASA website</a>, a year on Mars lasts 669.6 sols, which is the same as 687 Earth days.
